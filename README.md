Titanic Survival Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features from the dataset. 
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition.

Introduction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. 
By analyzing various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare, the model provides insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following files:

train.csv: Training dataset containing features and the target variable.


Model Training and Evaluation
The Jupyter notebook includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.
Model Selection: Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation: Comparing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected for making predictions on the test set.
Prediction: Generating predictions for the test dataset and preparing the submission file.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation set. Detailed results and performance metrics are provided in the Jupyter notebook.
